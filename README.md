## Flutter Test

> **For Unit/Widget Test:**

Use `flutter test` command to run both unit tests and widget tests in Flutter.

If you want to run tests in a specific file, you can provide the path to the test file:

    flutter test path/to/test_file.dart
    
Replace `path/to/test_file.dart` with the actual path to the test file.

> **For Integration Test:**

Run `flutter test integration_test` command to execute integration tests after establishing a connection to a device.
